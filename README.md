# yjump

Stupid terminal game.
Arrow keys (or WASD / ZSQD) to play.

- Choose a direction, then jump with up arrow. Only key press counts.
- Stop a jump with down arrow.
- Double jump with up arrow.
- Dash by double-tapping left or right.

The goal is to collide with the other characters.

# Install

```
cargo install yjump
```

# Run

```
yjump
```
